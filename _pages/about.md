I am an evolutionary ecologist dabbling in microbiology in an attempt to better understand the ways in which microbial symbionts influence the evolution of their animal hosts.  

Specifically, my work investigates how these relationships impact the developmental, and ultimately evolutionary, outcomes of different populations, and species of *Onthophagus* dung beetles.  

To investigate these questions I have married molecular, bioinformatic and animal husbandry techniques with sound statistical analysis and rigorous experimental design.  

When not wearing my biologist hat, I spend the majority of my time as a personal chef, running stroller chauffeur, and personal jungle gym for my two kiddos.
