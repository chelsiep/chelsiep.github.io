I am an evolutionary ecologist dabbling in microbiology in an attempt to better understand the ways in which microbial symbionts influence the evolution of their animal hosts. 
Specifically, my work investigates how these relationships impact the developmental, and ultimately evolutionary, outcomes of different populations, and species of *Onthophagus* dung beetles.
